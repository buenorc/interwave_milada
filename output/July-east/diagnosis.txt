Interwave Analyzer diagnosis

> Warning: the temporal resolution of the decomposition model is higher than the temporal resolution of analysis 
> The resolution of the decomposition model has been changed to the same of the resolution data 
> dt=5min


> Warning: Metalimnion borders have not been computed efficiently 8% of the total analyzed period 
> In this case metalimnion thickness is assumed to have a 1/3 thickness of the total water depth 


> Warning: V1H1 period has been estimated from time averaged profiles  
> 39% of the total analyzed period 
> It may occurs due to the difficulty to Interwave Analyzer identify the two-layer structure 


> Warning: V2H1 period has been estimated from time averaged profiles  
> 39% of the total analyzed period 
> It may occurs due to the difficulty to Interwave Analyzer identify the three-layer structure 


> Warning: Thermocline was estimated using the approximation of the fastest density gradient
> 5% of the total analyzed period 
> It may occurs due to a division by zero in the more sofisticated method
