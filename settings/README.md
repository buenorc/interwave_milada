1. **Settings file (.set)**: This is the configuration file that stores all parameters, calibration values, and specifies the path where input text files are stored. You can load this file within the Interwave Analyzer by selecting it from the File menu. Before loading the file into the Interwave Analyzer, remember to update the file paths for the input data (e.g., temperature, meteorological data, and output path) to match the location where the files are stored on your computer.
